# CapstoneGods
To run the UI, create a virtual environment with Python 3.9 and activate it:
```
python3.9 -m venv venv2
source venv2/bin/activate
```

Go to the capstone folder through the terminal, and install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the Wav2Lip zip file at https://drive.google.com/file/d/13cwrAED4l-x-Cf2veB4O28I2j_sNxDhk/view?usp=sharing,
extract it and insert it in the project folder.

Then run the UI on a local server with the command:
```
python app.py
```

Wait for it to finish loading. Then open in an incognito tab:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
